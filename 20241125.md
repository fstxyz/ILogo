# Discussion Summary

## Current Work Demonstration

This week, we performed text feature extraction from sample images and created several image processing functions.

Feature extraction was done using ChatGPT-4, and we ultimately obtained text descriptions of features for approximately 5,000 images.

We also wrote several image processing functions, including flipping images horizontally and vertically, inverting colors, and more. These functions were applied to the input images before querying the model, and we achieved a slight improvement in accuracy.



## Things to Improve

**Create new functions**

We need to create additional functions, such as background transparency and text removal, as we anticipate that processing the images in this way will make the model's queries more standardized and accurate.

**Optimize the prompt**

The text features obtained from ChatGPT-4 earlier were not standardized enough and need improvement in the prompts.

## Next Action

First of all, we need to optimize the examples where the model performed poorly. This includes creating a new background removal function, using other models for text removal, and further optimizing the color inversion function.  

And we need to improve the prompt used for calling ChatGPT-4, making it more detailed so that the text feature results obtained are more standardized. Then, we can continue with feature extraction for the sample images.
