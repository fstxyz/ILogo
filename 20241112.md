# Discussion Summary

## Current Work Demonstration

This week, we optimized the front end to make it more visually appealing. 

We also collected some examples of logos that were deemed similar and tested the model based on these examples.  

In addition, we used ChatGPT-4 to test similar tasks in order to compare and evaluate the performance of the CLIP model we are using.

## Things to Improve

**Intelligentize the front end**

We need to make the front end more intelligent, meaning that when a user clicks on a specific part of an image, the system should be able to extract and recognize the elements in that area of the image. This is the ultimate goal we aim to achieve.

**Improving the model's query accuracy**

From the test results, our model only succeeded in 5 out of 23 test cases, indicating that there is significant room for improvement. We need to try different approaches to enhance its accuracy.

## Next Action

First of all, we need to conduct relevant research on extracting image elements to meet the requirements for making our front end more intelligent.  

And we need to improve the model's accuracy by exploring two different approaches: extracting features using text and applying functional processing to the images.
